android-notif-hist
==================

NotificationListenerService is the new introduced API from API 18.
It allows application to track status bar notifcation post and removal.

I'd like to integrate this and see what to do next.

Current status:

Log notification to logcat

TODO:
Save to private db
Display them in activity
Group them by package
